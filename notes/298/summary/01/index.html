      <h1 class='content__title'>Financial Statement Analysis</h1>
      <h2 class='content__subtitle'>Strategies</h2>
      <p>Firms can generally be categorized to one of two strategies &mdash; differentiator or low cost provider.</p>
      <p><strong>Differentiators</strong> are generally luxury manufacturers. They sell a low quantity of goods with high prices.</p>
      <p><strong>Low cost providers</strong> are sellers of cheaper goods. They have much higher sales volumes but each good has a lower profit margin.</p>
      <p>Differentiating between them is simple. There is a general rule based on their financial ratios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Differentiator &mdash; high net profit margin, low asset turnover</li>
        <li>Low cost provider &mdash; low net profit margin, high asset turnover</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where asset turnover is defined as <code class='code--inline'>sales/assets</code> and net profit margin is defined as <code class='code--inline'>net income/sales</code>.</p>
      <h2 class='content__subtitle'>Potential Equity Investments</h2>
      <p>To choose potential investment options we have to look into the current financial status of the company. Essentially there are four measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Liquidity</strong> &mdash; ability for a company to pay off its short-term debts</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> &mdash; how well a company uses its assets/liabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Profitability</strong> &mdash; the company's capacity to make a profit</li>
        <li><strong>Solvency</strong> &mdash; the company's net income compared to its debts</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class='content__subtitle'>Forecast Future Net Income</h2>
      <p>Assuming we know the rate of growth and the correct ratios, calculating future net income is simple.</p>
      <p>Say we are given the following information:</p>
      <table class='table--stem'>
        <tr>
          <td>First-year sales</td>
          <td>$100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Annual sales growth</td>
          <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>COGS (as % of sales)</td>
          <td>30%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Operating expenses<br>(as % of sales)</td>
          <td>55%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tax rate</td>
          <td>30%</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>If we want to calculate the net income for next year, we just calculate the growth of sales and calculate the rest (shown on right).</p>
      <p>Often we are not explicitly given the growth rate, but we are given return on equity and retention rate. From there we can derive the growth rate as follows:</p>
      <div class='math'>G = RoE * RR</div>
      <h2 class='content__subtitle'>Forecast Future Cash Flow</h2>
      <p>If we would like to know the future cash flow, we need to follow the steps shown on the right.</p>
      <p>Let's try to predict the future cash flow from the previous example. We are given the following data:</p>
      <table class='table--stem'>
        <tr>
          <td>First-year sales</td>
          <td>$100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Annual sales growth</td>
          <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Noncash working capital<br>(as % of sales)</td>
          <td>70%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Annual investment in fixed capital<br>(as % of sales)</td>
          <td>5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Beginning noncash working capital</td>
          <td>$75</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Beginning cash</td>
          <td>$10</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>We know from the previous example that sales is <code class='code--inline'>$120</code> and net income is <code class='code--inline'>$12.6</code>. Thus we also know the following numbers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Noncash working capital &mdash; $84</li>
        <li>Investment in fixed capital &mdash; $6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now we need to find the investment in working capital. We know that the required working capital is 70% of sales. Thus the previous working capital would be:</p>
      <div class='math'>70% x 100$ = $70</div>
      <p>Therefore the investment in working capital would be the new required working capital minus the previous working capital:</p>
      <div class='math'>$84 - $70 = $14</div>
      <p>Thus the change in cash would be:</p>
      <div class='math'>$12.6 - $14 - $6 = -$7.4</div>
      <p>Since beginning cash is $10, ending cash would be:</p>
      <div class='math'>$10 - $7.4 = $2.6</div>
